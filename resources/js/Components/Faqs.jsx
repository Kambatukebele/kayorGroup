            response: `The Difference Between Proofreading and Copyediting

                While proofreading and copyediting are both essential steps in the editing process, they serve different purposes and occur at different stages:

                Copyediting:

                1. Occurs earlier in the editing process
                2. Focuses on improving the overall quality and clarity of the writing
                3. Involves:
                    - Correcting grammar, spelling, and punctuation
                    - Ensuring consistency in style, tone, and formatting
                    - Improving sentence structure and flow
                    - Checking for proper word usage and clarity
                    - Addressing issues with logic and coherence
                4. May include some fact-checking and verifying references
                5. Can involve substantial rewriting or restructuring of text

                Proofreading:

                1. Is the final step before publication or submission
                2. Focuses on catching any remaining errors or inconsistencies
                3. Involves:
                    - Correcting minor errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation
                    - Checking for consistent formatting (e.g., fonts, headings, page numbers)
                    - Ensuring proper layout and design elements
                    - Verifying that all edits from previous stages have been correctly implemented
                4. Does not typically involve major rewrites or content changes
                5. Aims to produce an error-free final draft.

                In essence, copyediting is a more in-depth process that improves the overall quality of the writing, while proofreading is a final check to catch any lingering errors before the document is finalized.`,
